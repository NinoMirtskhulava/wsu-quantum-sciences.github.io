## Research Interests

### Quantum Information
We study quantum algorithms, quantum machine learning, and quantum error correction.

### Quantum Hardware
We are interested in room-temperature quantum devices and how qubit topology affects algorithm implementability.

## Resources
A series of Jupyter notebooks on Qiskit [here](https://github.com/BrianOtieno/quantum-computing).<br>
A collection of all quantum error correction techniques [here](https://errorcorrectionzoo.org/domain/quantum_domain).
